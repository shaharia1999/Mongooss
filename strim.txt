Selection processes are a crucial part of talent management. Making them more efficient saves the company money, and nowadays you can find specialist software to help you do just that. As we'll see below, ATS software speeds up recruitment processes and helps you become more successful at selecting professionals.

 

What is an applicant tracking system?
 

An applicant tracking system (ATS) is an HR software that acts as a CV database. It enables companies to easily organise and filter them and help them find the best person for the job.

The system enables recruiters to review applications, send automatic messages to candidates to confirm receipt of their information, and even carry out online tests. Processes become automated and move faster at the same time, reducing the time taken from publishing the vacancy to incorporating the new employee.

What do applicant tracking systems do?
 

The objective of ATS software is to simplify the HR department's recruitment and selection processes. It's not unusual for a company to have several selection processes running at the same time, and to receive hundreds, if not thousands of applications a day. It's impossible to examine them meticulously one by one, but specialist software certainly can.

Once all the candidates have been filtered, the system can perform an extensive follow-up. In other words, the HR department can use the ATS to talk to candidates and automate communications. As a result, this provides a better experience for the professionals involved in the process.

So, it's a tool that reduces the complexity of recruitment processes by providing a single platform which can review, filter and track applications.

 

 

Benefits of an applicant tracking system
 

We've already mentioned some of the benefits of using an application tracking system, but let's take a more in-depth look into each one:

 

Speeds up the hiring process: or rather, the number of days it takes to from the moment the job is advertised until the new recruit starts at the company. It's a key metric that proves the efficiency of the process, which also becomes faster with the use of an ATS. A study by GetApp (2017) revealed that 86% of HR professionals agree that an ATS system helped them speed up their recruiting processes.
Reduces cost per hire: because it takes time and resources (salaries, advertising, technology, etc.) to fill a vacancy. Optimising your process with an ATS produces direct savings for your company. And automating many of the tasks involved in the hiring process, therefore increases profitability.
Improves the quality of hire: we calculate this by taking into account the value the employee brings through their performance and by the length of time they stay in the company. This metric demonstrates the efficiency of the process. ATS systems work with artificial intelligence and are capable of filtering hundreds of CVs to find the candidates that best suit the job requirements. The GetApp also showed that 78% of professionals interviewed confirmed that using specialist technology improved the quality of hire.
Improves the candidate experience: as they receive updated, real-time information about the recruitment process. ATS software automates all communications, meaning that it doesn't create extra work for the HR department. It's vital to offer a good experience: on the one hand, it encourages the candidate to accept the offer; and on the other, because it has the potential to turn candidates into a company ambassador, or even a client.
Enhances the company's brand identity: a consistent and engaging selection process strengthens the company's image. With an ATS, the HR department can attract and manage more candidates but with an exceptional level of attention and follow-up.

It's not unusual for a company to have several selection processes running at the same time, and to receive hundreds, if not thousands of applications a day. It's impossible to examine them meticulously one by one, but specialist software certainly can.

Once all the candidates have been filtered, the system can perform an extensive follow-up. In other words, the HR department can use the ATS to talk to candidates and automate communications. As a result, this provides a better experience for the professionals involved in the process.

So, it's a tool that reduces the complexity of recruitment processes by providing a single platform which can review, filter and track applications.

 

 

Benefits of an applicant tracking system
 

We've already mentioned some of the benefits of using an application tracking system, but let's take a more in-depth look into each one:

 

Speeds up the hiring process: or rather, the number of days it takes to from the moment the job is advertised until the new recruit starts at the company. It's a key metric that proves the efficiency of the process, which also becomes faster with the use of an ATS. A study by GetApp (2017) revealed that 86% of HR professionals agree that an ATS system helped them speed up their recruiting processes.
Reduces cost per hire: because it takes time and resources (salaries, advertising, technology, etc.) to fill a vacancy. Optimising your process with an ATS produces direct savings for your company. And automating many of the tasks involved in the hiring process, therefore increases profitability.
Improves the quality of hire: we calculate this by taking into account the value the employee brings through their performance and by the length of time they stay in the company. This metric demonstrates the efficiency of the process. ATS systems work with artificial intelligence and are capable of filtering hundreds of CVs to find the candidates that best suit the job requirements. The GetApp also showed that 78% of professionals interviewed confirmed that using specialist technology improved the quality of hire.
Improves the candidate experience: as they receive updated, real-time information about the recruitment process. ATS software automates all communications, meaning that it doesn't create extra work for the HR department. It's vital to offer a good experience: on the one hand, it encourages the candidate to accept the offer; and on the other, because it has the potential to turn candidates into a company ambassador, or even a client.
Enhances the company's brand identity: a consistent and engaging selection process strengthens the company's image. With an ATS, the HR department can attract and manage more candidates but with an exceptional level of attention and follow-up.
Selection processes are a crucial part of talent management. Making them more efficient saves the company money, and nowadays you can find specialist software to help you do just that. As we'll see below, ATS software speeds up recruitment processes and helps you become more successful at selecting professionals.

 

What is an applicant tracking system?
 

An applicant tracking system (ATS) is an HR software that acts as a CV database. It enables companies to easily organise and filter them and help them find the best person for the job.

The system enables recruiters to review applications, send automatic messages to candidates to confirm receipt of their information, and even carry out online tests. Processes become automated and move faster at the same time, reducing the time taken from publishing the vacancy to incorporating the new employee.

Speeds up the hiring process: or rather, the number of days it takes to from the moment the job is advertised until the new recruit starts at the company. It's a key metric that proves the efficiency of the process, which also becomes faster with the use of an ATS. A study by GetApp (2017) revealed that 86% of HR professionals agree that an ATS system helped them speed up their recruiting processes.
Reduces cost per hire: because it takes time and resources (salaries, advertising, technology, etc.) to fill a vacancy. Optimising your process with an ATS produces direct savings for your company. And automating many of the tasks involved in the hiring process, therefore increases profitability.
Improves the quality of hire: we calculate this by taking into account the value the employee brings through their performance and by the length of time they stay in the company. This metric demonstrates the efficiency of the process. ATS systems work with artificial intelligence and are capable of filtering hundreds of CVs to find the candidates that best suit the job requirements. The GetApp also showed that 78% of professionals interviewed confirmed that using specialist technology improved the quality of hire.
Improves the candidate experience: as they receive updated, real-time information about the recruitment process. ATS software automates all communications, meaning that it doesn't create extra work for the HR department. It's vital to offer a good experience: on the one hand, it encourages the candidate to accept the offer; and on the other, because it has the potential to turn candidates into a company ambassador, or even a client.
Enhances the company's brand identity: a consistent and engaging selection process strengthens the company's image. With an ATS, the HR department can attract and manage more candidates but with an exceptional level of attention and follow-up.
Selection processes are a crucial part of talent management. Making them more efficient saves the company money, and nowadays you can find specialist software to help you do just that. As we'll see below, ATS software speeds up recruitment processes and helps you become more successful at selecting professionals.

 

What is an applicant tracking system?
 

An applicant tracking system (ATS) is an HR software that acts as a CV database. It enables companies to easily organise and filter them and help them find the best person for the job.

The system enables recruiters to review applications, send automatic messages to candidates to confirm receipt of their information, and even carry out online tests. Processes become automated and move faster at the same time, reducing the time taken from publishing the vacancy to incorporating the new employee.

What do applicant tracking systems do?
 

The objective of ATS software is to simplify the HR department's recruitment and selection processes. It's not unusual for a company to have several selection processes running at the same time, and to receive hundreds, if not thousands of applications a day. It's impossible to examine them meticulously one by one, but specialist software certainly can.

Once all the candidates have been filtered, the system can perform an extensive follow-up. In other words, the HR department can use the ATS to talk to candidates and automate communications. As a result, this provides a better experience for the professionals involved in the process.

So, it's a tool that reduces the complexity of recruitment processes by providing a single platform which can review, filter and track applications.
